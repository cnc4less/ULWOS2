# ULWOS2
A super lightweight cooperative OS completely written in C which can target almost any platform.
ULWOS2 is different because it doesn't store a full context for each task, this greatly reduces stack usage.
## Basic API
* ULWOS2_INIT - initilizes ULWOS2
* ULWOS2_THREAD_CREATE - creates a new ULWOS2 thread
* ULWOS2_THREAD_KILL - kills (destroys) current thread
* ULWOS2_START_SCHEDULER - starts ULWOS2 scheduler (this function does not return)
* ULWOS2_THREAD_START - this is the entity that enables jumping to a specific point within the thread when resuming;
* ULWOS2_THREAD_YIELD - yields back to the scheduler. This is used for givingÂ  a chance of other threads to run (it doesn't block the thread);
* ULWOS2_THREAD_SLEEP_MS - blocks the thread for a specific amount of milliseconds;
* ULWOS2_THREAD_SEND_SIGNAL - sends a signal to other threads;
* ULWOS2_THREAD_WAIT_FOR_SIGNAL - suspends the thread until the given signal arrives;
* ULWOS2_THREAD_RESET - reinitialize thread internal pointer (but does not touch any local variable). This forces the thread to run from the beginning;
